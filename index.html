      <h1>PROCESS</h1>
      <p>Using three separate methods of brewing coffee – V60, French press, espresso – we will offer our personal takings from the coffees we review, and score them on a 0 to 10 scale. The two of us have very different preferences and abilities, so we are able to provide our readers with a good viewpoint of the coffees.</p>
      <h1>THE SCALE</h1>
      <p> The 0 to 10 scale is not a random score. We score on Aroma, Brightness, Mouthfeel, Flavor, Finish, Balance. These are scored 0 to 10, and are then averaged to find the final score for that method. At the end of the process of brewing all three methods – which are not done simultaneously – those three scores are then averaged to get the final score for that coffee. </p>
