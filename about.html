      <p>He is David. An analytical thinker with a strong inclination to seek every morsel of knowledge on how things function. He is driven to find the core of every issue in order to amend or avoid it. His pursuit of a more minimalist lifestyle infused with his burgeoning affection for C. arabica kindled the purista in him.</p>
      <p>She is Mae. An exuberant dreamer and visionary.  Her kinship with coffee is one of the most enduring and defining aspects of her persona. Following suit in her husband’s passion towards minimalism she coined “purista” as the proper term for their niche in the coffee industry. </p>
      <p>Together they lend their voices, knowledge, and principles to this dwelling. A place for those that share their ardor to seek culture, education, and share experience related to coffee without too much fluff. Home baristas and budding coffee enthusiasts will find themselves right at home, in an environment fostering their growing passions and thirst for knowledge on Caffea.</p>
